# Exploring real Health Care data using Pandas  

The US famously has the most expensive healthcare system in the world.  Study after study shows that while costs for the same course of treatment vary widely between hospitals, patient outcomes are generally not correlated with these costs.  Compounding this problem is the fact that healthcare treatment and cost data are notoriously difficult to interpret.  So most people do not consider costs when seeking treatment.  However, you as a data scientist are much better equipped to do so than an average consumer.  Where would you seek treatment?  

For the purposes of this sprint, let's start by focusing on a single disease: *Viral Meningitis* and how the cost of treatment varies among the hospitals in our data.  

### The first goal of this sprint is to find which hospital charges the most for treating *Viral Meningitis*.
We will be using the data file `hospital-costs.csv` located in the data folder.

Here is how to start off.  

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data/hospital-costs.csv")
````
1.  Now, look at and familiarize yourself with the dataset you will be working with.  
2.  Keep the official pandas documentation handy and apply generously as needed. http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/


The amount in the charge/costs columns is the price per discharge. Most hospitals treat many people with the same illness.  The amount they treat is the number in the "Discharges" column.


### It is your job to calculate all the cost totals.
1. Create a new column "Total Charges" using "Discharges" and "Mean Charge".  
2. Do the same for the "Total Costs" using "Mean Cost".
2. With these two new "Total Charges" and "Total Costs" columns, calculate the charges to costs "markup" rate.
3. Tell me which facility has the highest "markup" rate, and which one has the lowest "markup" rate.  (It's always good to do a sanity check, do these results make sense to you?)

    Results:

    #### Lowest
    | Facility Name | ... | Total Charge | Total Cost | Markup|
    | ------------- |---|:-------------:| -----:|------|
    |TLC Health Network Tri-County Memorial Hospital | ...|  1540540    | 97482510  | 0.015803|

    #### Highest
    | Facility Name | ... | Total Charge | Total Cost | Markup|
    | ------------- |---|:-------------:| -----:|------|
    | SUNY Downstate Medical Center at LICH | ... | 43088   | 2068  | 20.835590|


# Out of curiosity...
I wonder what everyone is going to the hospital for...
Use a groupby method on the Description column and sum the Discharges.

1.  What are the top 10 reasons people are going to the hospital for, and how many people did they see.

# Now, let's follow the money...
Now we want to see which hospital has the most money coming.
To keep this from getting messy, lets create a new DataFrame with only the columns we care about.  
1.  Create a new DataFrame named "net" that is only the Facility Name, Total Charge, Total Cost from our original DataFrame  
2.  Find the total amount each hospital spent, and how much they charged. (Group your data by Facility names, and sum all the total costs and total charges)  
3.  Now find the net income for every hospital. Tell me the most profitable and the least profitable ones and how much are they making?  


| Facility Name | Total Charge | Total Cost | Net Income |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adirondack Medical Center-Saranac Lake Site|141573499.0|77427664.0|64145835.0 |
| Albany Medical Center - South Clinical Campus|1802808.0|1432784.0|370024.0 |
| Albany Medical Center Hospital|3763945310.0|1336298908.0|2427646402.0 |
| Albany Memorial Hospital|221974029.0|94907174.0|127066855.0 |



# Now, let's focus in on *Viral Meningitis*
1. Create a new dataframe that only contains the data corresponding to *Viral Meningitis*  
    ```python
    
    newdf = df[df["APR DRG Description"] == "Viral Meningitis"]
    ```
2. Now, with our new dataframe, only keep the data columns we care about which are:  
    `["Facility Name", "APR DRG Description","APR Severity of Illness Description","Discharges", "Mean Charge", "Median Charge", "Mean Cost"]`

3. Our new dataframe should look somewhat like this:

    |Facility Name|APR DRG Description|APR Severity of Illness Description|Discharges|Mean Charge|Median Charge|Mean Cost|
    |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
    |Adirondack Medical Center-Saranac Lake Site|Viral Meningitis|Minor|1|17116.0|17116.0|7006.0|
    |Albany Medical Center Hospital|Viral Meningitis|Minor|19|13212.0|11914.0|4569.0|
    |Albany Medical Center Hospital|Viral Meningitis|Moderate|11|21197.0|14197.0|7131.0|
    |Albany Medical Center Hospital|Viral Meningitis|Major|6|28074.0|22846.0|7495.0|


3. Find which hospital is the least expensive (based on "Mean Charge") for treating Moderate cases of VM. [*note example below is the most expensive not the least*]


    |Facility Name|APR DRG Description|APR Severity of Illness Description|Discharges|Mean Charge|Median Charge|Mean Cost|
    |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
    |Beth Israel Med Center-Kings Hwy Div|Viral Meningitis|Moderate|1|71663.0|71663.0|12658.0|
    |Lutheran Medical Center|Viral Meningitis|Moderate|2|71850.0|71850.0|50605.0|
    |New York Presbyterian Hospital - Downtown Division|Viral Meningitis|Moderate|1|76528.0|76528.0|27563.0|
    |St Lukes Roosevelt Hospital - St Lukes Hospital Division|Viral Meningitis|Moderate|4|79245.0|48006.0|24743.0|
    |Orange Regional Medical Center|Viral Meningitis|Moderate|1|84003.0|84003.0|23143.0|


4. Find which hospital is the least expensive for treating Moderate cases of VM **that have more than 3 Discharges**.

    |Facility Name|APR DRG Description|APR Severity of Illness Description|Discharges|Mean Charge|Median Charge|Mean Cost|
    |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
    |Cayuga Medical Center at Ithaca|Viral Meningitis|Moderate|6|5738.0|5111.0|3949.0|
    |Women And Children's Hospital Of Buffalo|Viral Meningitis|Moderate|31|6601.0|6182.0|2770.0|
    |Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital|Viral Meningitis|Moderate|6|6614.0|6784.0|2649.0|

1. Find which hospital discharges the most cases of Viral Meningitis for all levels of severity.

    | Facility Name | ... | Discharges |
    | ------------- |-----|:----------:|
    | North Shore University Hospital | ... | 158 |
    | Montefiore Medical Center - Henry & Lucy Moses Div | ... | 152 |
    | Strong Memorial Hospital | ... | 117 |

1. Find if there is a correlation between the severity of illness and the charge. Hint use df.corr() *http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/computation.html#correlation*


# Data can be tricky   
1. Which illness has the most discharges?  It seems like an easy query, but data can be tricky.

Notice the "APR DRG Description" should be unique for each hospital, however, hospitals also have a label for how severe that illness is.  So each illness can be listed up to four times. They are separated and labeled accordingly with the "APR Severity of Illness Description" (i.e. Viral Meningitis with Moderate severity and Viral Meningitis with Minor severity should be considered two different illnesses). This is annoying because it just is.
**To account for this you have to group by two columns...**
*  Group the APR DRG Description with the of severity for each Illness.  
*  What is the most expensive type of illness?
